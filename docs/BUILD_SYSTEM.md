# Sokol Library Build System

This directory contains scripts and G#### Linux
- Architecture: x86_64
- Runner: ubuntu-latest
- Compiler: GCC
- Dependencies: X11, ### Auto-commit Behavior

### When Libraries Are Committed
The workflow automatically commits built libraries to the repository when:
- ✅ Building from `main` branch
- ✅ Triggered by a push event (not PR)
- ✅ All builds complete successfully
- ✅ **Libraries have actually changed** (checksum comparison)

### Smart Change Detection
Before committing, the workflow:
1. Downloads existing libraries from the repository
2. Compares checksums (SHA256) of old vs new binaries
3. Only commits if binaries are different
4. Skips commit if no changes detected

This prevents unnecessary commits when:
- Only documentation is updated
- Only non-library code is changed
- Builds produce identical binaries, Xi, ALSA, Mesa GL
- Output: .so files
- Note: ARM64 builds should be done natively on ARM64 hardwareActions workflows for building the sokol native libraries across multiple platforms.

## Supported Platforms

- **Windows**: x64 (Debug & Release)
- **macOS**: arm64, x86_64 (Debug & Release)
- **Linux**: x86_64 (Debug & Release)
- **Web (Emscripten)**: x86 (Debug & Release)

> **Note**: Android and iOS libraries are compiled on-the-fly during project build and are not included in the CI/CD pipeline.
> 
> **Android Build Requirements**: 
> - **NDK 27+ required** for Google Play submission (16KB page size support for Android 15+ / API 35+)
> - The build system automatically selects NDK 27+ when available, preferring it over older versions
> - All native Android libraries are automatically built with 16KB alignment
> - NDK 29+ recommended for best compatibility

> **Note**: Linux ARM64 (aarch64) is not included in CI/CD due to cross-compilation complexity. ARM64 Linux builds should be done natively on ARM64 hardware if needed.

## Local Build Scripts

### macOS
```bash
./scripts/build-xcode-macos.sh
```
Builds both Debug and Release configurations for the current architecture (arm64 or x86_64).

### Windows
```powershell
.\scripts\build-vs2022-windows.ps1
```
Builds both Debug and Release configurations using Visual Studio 2022.
Output: `libs/windows/{arch}/debug/` and `libs/windows/{arch}/release/`

### Linux
```bash
./scripts/build-linux-library.sh
```
Builds both Debug and Release configurations using GCC/Clang.
Output: `libs/linux/{arch}/debug/` and `libs/linux/{arch}/release/`

### Web (Emscripten)
```bash
./scripts/build-web-library.sh
```
Builds both Debug and Release static libraries using Emscripten 3.1.34.
Output: `libs/emscripten/x86/debug/` and `libs/emscripten/x86/release/`

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

The project includes automated builds via GitHub Actions defined in `.github/workflows/build-libraries.yml`.

### Triggers
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Automated Jobs

The workflow includes two main automation jobs:

#### 1. C# Binding Generation
- **Generates C# bindings** from sokol C headers using Python scripts
- **Output**: `src/sokol/generated/*.cs` and `ext/sokol_csharp_internal_wrappers.h`
- **Smart detection**: Only commits if bindings actually changed
- **Triggers**: Runs on every push to `main` branch
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.x

#### 2. Auto-commit to Repository
When building from the `main` branch (push event), the workflow will:
1. **Generate C# bindings** from C headers (separate job)
2. **Build all platform libraries** in parallel
3. **Compare** new libraries with existing ones using SHA256 checksums
4. **Only commit** if binaries or bindings have changed (prevents spam commits)
5. **Push** to `main` branch with commit message `[skip ci]` to prevent infinite loops
6. **Include** build information (commit SHA, workflow run link, library sizes)

**Requirements for Private Repositories:**
The workflow requires `contents: write` permission to push commits back to the repository. This is configured in the workflow file and works automatically for both public and private repositories.

**Smart Change Detection:**

*For Bindings:*
- Uses `git diff` to detect changes in generated C# files
- Only commits when C header files change
- Skips commit for documentation or build system changes

*For Libraries:*
- On **first run**: Detects no existing libraries and commits everything
- On **subsequent runs**: Compares SHA256 checksums of each platform's libraries
- Only commits when **native code changes** affect the binaries
- Skips commit when only **documentation** or **C# code** changes

This ensures the repository always has the latest pre-built binaries and up-to-date C# bindings available for users to clone and use immediately, without cluttering the commit history.

   - `windows-x64`
   - `macos-arm64`
   - `macos-x86_64`
   - `linux-x86_64`
   - `emscripten-x86`

2. **Combined artifact** (90-day retention):
   - `sokol-libraries-all-platforms` - All libraries in proper directory structure

3. **Release archives** (90-day retention, only on main branch):
   - `sokol-libraries.tar.gz`
   - `sokol-libraries.zip`

### Workflow Execution Order

The GitHub Actions workflow executes jobs in the following order:

```
Push to main/develop
       ↓
   ┌───┴───────────────────────────┐
   │                               │
   ↓                               ↓
Generate Bindings         Build Libraries (Parallel)
   │                      ├─→ Windows x64
   │                      ├─→ macOS arm64
   │                      ├─→ macOS x86_64
   │                      ├─→ Linux x86_64
   │                      └─→ Emscripten
   │                               │
   │                               ↓
   │                      Combine Artifacts
   │                               │
   ↓                               ↓
Check bindings changed?    Check libraries changed?
   │                               │
   └───────────┬───────────────────┘
               ↓
      Commit if changed [skip ci]
```

**Key Points:**
- Binding generation and library builds run **independently in parallel**
- Each can commit separately if changes are detected
- `[skip ci]` in commit messages prevents infinite loops
- Failed builds don't affect binding generation (and vice versa)

### Downloading Built Libraries

After a successful workflow run:

1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Click on the completed workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Download `sokol-libraries-all-platforms` for all libraries
5. Or download individual platform artifacts as needed

The downloaded artifacts maintain the same directory structure as local builds:
```
libs/
├── windows/
│   └── x64/
│       ├── debug/
│       │   ├── sokol.dll
│       │   └── sokol.lib
│       └── release/
│           ├── sokol.dll
│           └── sokol.lib
├── macos/
│   ├── arm64/
│   │   ├── debug/libsokol.dylib
│   │   └── release/libsokol.dylib
│   └── x86_64/
│       ├── debug/libsokol.dylib
│       └── release/libsokol.dylib
├── linux/
│   └── x86_64/
│       ├── debug/libsokol.so
│       └── release/libsokol.so
└── emscripten/
    └── x86/
        ├── debug/sokol.a
        └── release/sokol.a
```

## Manual Workflow Dispatch

You can manually trigger the build workflow from GitHub:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Build Sokol Libraries" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select branch to build from
5. Click "Run workflow"

This is useful for testing or building from a feature branch.

## Auto-commit Behavior

### When Libraries Are Committed
The workflow automatically commits built libraries to the repository when:
- ✅ Building from `main` branch
- ✅ Triggered by a push event (not PR)
- ✅ All builds complete successfully

### Preventing Infinite Loops
The commit message includes `[skip ci]` which tells GitHub Actions to **not** trigger the workflow again. This prevents:
- Infinite build loops
- Wasted CI/CD minutes
- Unnecessary builds

### Commit Message Format
```
Auto-update built libraries [skip ci]

Built from commit: abc123def456
Workflow run: https://github.com/user/repo/actions/runs/123456

Platform sizes:
- Windows x64: 7.3M
- macOS arm64: 6.4M
- macOS x86_64: 6.5M
- Linux x86_64: 10.7M
- Emscripten: 18.9M
```

### Workflow Output Examples

- ✅ Always in sync with source code
- ✅ Clear traceability (commit SHA and workflow run link)
- ✅ **No unnecessary commits** - only when binaries change
- ✅ Cleaner git history - no spam commits

## Requirements

### Local Build Requirements

#### macOS
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- CMake 3.16+

#### Windows
- Visual Studio 2022
- CMake 3.16+

#### Linux
- GCC or Clang
- CMake 3.16+
- Development packages: `libx11-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`, `libxi-dev`, `libasound2-dev`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`

#### Web
- Emscripten SDK 3.1.34 (managed by `tools/emsdk` submodule)

### GitHub Actions Requirements

All dependencies are automatically installed by the workflow. No additional setup required.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If a build fails locally or in CI:

1. Check that all git submodules are initialized:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Ensure CMake version is 3.16 or higher:
   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```

3. For Linux, ensure all development packages are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libasound2-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
   ```

4. For Web builds, ensure Emscripten SDK is properly initialized:
   ```bash
   cd tools/emsdk
   ./emsdk install 3.1.34
   ./emsdk activate 3.1.34
   source ./emsdk_env.sh
   ```

### Architecture-specific Issues

#### Linux ARM64 (Not in CI/CD)
ARM64 Linux builds are **not included in the CI/CD pipeline** due to cross-compilation complexity and repository limitations. 

**For ARM64 Linux builds:**
- Build natively on ARM64 hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton)
- Or use QEMU user-mode emulation for cross-compilation locally

**Native ARM64 build (recommended):**
```bash
# On ARM64 Linux machine
./scripts/build-linux-library.sh
```

**Cross-compilation (advanced, may have issues):**
Cross-compiling from x86_64 to ARM64 requires multi-arch setup which is unreliable on GitHub Actions. If you need to cross-compile locally, you can attempt it at your own risk.

#### GCC vs Clang Compiler Differences
The CMakeLists.txt automatically handles compiler-specific flags:
- Clang-only flags (like `-Wincompatible-pointer-types-discards-qualifiers`) are only applied when using Clang
- GCC uses its own compatible warning flags
- This is handled automatically by detecting `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID`

#### X11 Macro Conflicts on Linux
On Linux, X11 headers define a `Status` macro that conflicts with struct members in cimgui:
- The `ext/sokol.c` file undefines the X11 `Status` macro before including cimgui
- This is done conditionally only on Linux (`#if defined(__linux__)`)
- Prevents compilation errors without affecting X11 functionality

#### macOS Universal Binaries
To create a universal binary (both arm64 and x86_64):
```bash
lipo -create \
  libs/macos/arm64/release/libsokol.dylib \
  libs/macos/x86_64/release/libsokol.dylib \
  -output libs/macos/universal/libsokol.dylib
```

#### GitHub Actions: 403 Error on Private Repositories
If you see this error when the workflow tries to push:
```
remote: Write access to repository not granted.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/...': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

**Solution:** Ensure the workflow has the `contents: write` permission. This is already configured in `.github/workflows/build-libraries.yml`:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Allow workflow to push commits
```

This permission is **required for private repositories** and works automatically once added. The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions.

## Contributing

When modifying the build system:

1. Test your changes locally first using the appropriate build script
2. Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow still passes
3. Update this README if adding new platforms or changing the build process
4. Verify that artifact structure remains consistent

## License

Same as the main Sokol.NET project.
